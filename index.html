                    <h1>Find Your Perfume Persona</h1>
                    <p>There is a whole world of fragrances out there from the zesty and fresh citrus scents to the warmer and softer jasmines and vanilla smelling perfumes. It's important to match up with the right perfume with your own personality. The perfume reacts differently to all of us and you can build up your own signature perfume persona. Our brain can unconsciously identify a staggering 10,0000 different smell and what we find appealing in a perfume often is a smell that the brain registered as a positive olfactory memory and is associated with a happy time in our lives often from childhood. You may well find that you prefer and pick perfumes from the same olfactory smell groups.</p>
